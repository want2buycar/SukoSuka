<h1>There is no video content to watch.</h1>
Only the icons without IPTV broadcasts
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long story short, I found dusktill, I got it from a YouTube channel. Feeling unsatisfied, I looked again. Meet Freemium IPTV. Then the Freemium IPTV website went down, but I still had time to copy the contents of the playlist.</p>
<p>Initially, I searched IPTV.org, then Yamcode, Telegram Group, Github, IPTVcat, Zaltv.co, Youtube, VK, DaddyLive, Dusktill, and so on.</p>
<p>Armed with a Playlist from Freemium IPTV, I supplemented several dead sources. Then added one by one to this playlist.</p>
<p>In the past, when looking for free IPTV was very easy, I really liked Freemium IPTV. But now everyone needs money, and it is increasingly difficult to find free IPTV sources. Even if it were possible, the method would be more complicated.</p>
<p>So I feel tired if I have to search for sources endlessly. So I decided to stop.</p>
